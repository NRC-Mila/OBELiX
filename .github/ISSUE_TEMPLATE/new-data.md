Attach your data to this form as a csv file. If you have CIFs, attach them in a separate tar or zip archive.

New data checklist:

- [ ] The data contains at least the following fields:  `ID, Reduced Composition, Z, True Composition, Ionic conductivity (S cm-1), Space group #, a, b, c, alpha, beta, gamma, DOI`
- [ ] The ionic conductivity was experimentally measured at room temperature (or extrapolated)
- [ ] The structural information was measured on the exact same material (same paper) as the ionic conductivity
- [ ] If you are uploading CIFs, they are named `[ID].cif` e.g. `1.cif`, `2.cif`, ... and are contained in a zip or tar archive.
