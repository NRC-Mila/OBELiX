# Machine learning to discover ionic conductors

This repository currently contains only the data set (see [data/README.md](https://github.com/alexhernandezgarcia/ionic-conductivity/tree/main/data)), that should not be made publicly available for the time being. Models code is currently developed in [github.com/sh-divya/ActiveLearningMaterials](https://github.com/sh-divya/ActiveLearningMaterials).
